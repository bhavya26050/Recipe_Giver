## Half Fried Eggs (Sunny Side Up)

### Ingredients:
- 2-3 fresh eggs
- 1-2 tablespoons butter or oil
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- Optional toppings: herbs, chili flakes, grated cheese

### Instructions:
1. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. Add butter or oil and let it melt/heat.
2. Crack each egg carefully into the pan, keeping yolks intact.
3. Cook slowly until the whites are completely set but the yolks are still runny, about 2-3 minutes.
4. Season with salt and pepper.
5. Serve immediately for the best taste and texture.

The half-fried egg cooking technique keeps the yolk liquid while setting the whites, creating that classic sunny-side-up presentation. Each egg provides about 70-80 calories and 6-7g of protein.

Would you like some suggestions for what to serve with your half fried eggs? Toast, avocado, and roasted tomatoes make excellent companions!`;
  } else if (query.includes("pasta") || query.includes("spaghetti")) {
    return `I don't have a specific database match for your request, but I can offer this recipe instead.

## Quick Garlic Pasta

### Ingredients:
- 8 oz pasta (any shape you prefer)
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 4-6 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes (optional, for a bit of heat)
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped

### Instructions:
1. Cook pasta according to package directions until al dente.
2. While pasta cooks, heat olive oil over medium heat in a large skillet.
3. Add minced garlic and red pepper flakes, cooking until fragrant (about 1 minute).
4. Reserve 1/2 cup pasta water, then drain pasta.
5. Add pasta to the skillet with garlic oil, tossing to coat.
6. Add Parmesan cheese and a splash of pasta water, stirring until creamy.
7. Season with salt and pepper, then garnish with fresh parsley.

This simple pasta has about 380 calories per serving with 15g fat, 48g carbs, and 12g protein.
